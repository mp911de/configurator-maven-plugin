Usage
============

Usage
---------

  The ${project.name} is generally used to configure packaged artifacts. You define one or more template files (naming pattern *.template.*) which will
  be processed. Template variables are replaced by property values.

  Example:

  Template-File **config.template.properties**

	username=@db.username@
	url=@db.url@


  Properties-File **production.properties**

	db.username=mark
	db.url=jdbc:mysql://...

  will become then

  **config.properties**

	username=mark
	url=jdbc:mysql://...

  This method is intended primarily for Java Web Applications and Java Enterprise Applications which are packaged as WAR
  or EAR file. As soon as you start packaging and deploying (artifact repository) environment-configured artifacts, the are
  not portable anymore. With this plugin you are able to create templated artifacts. Just before deployment you finalize
  the configuration by injecting property values into your WAR/EAR.

  All WAR's/JAR's within an EAR/WAR/JAR will be processed (recursive).


### The *configurator:configure* Goal

  The [configurator:configure](./configure-mojo.html) configures the build file from your current project.


### The *configurator:configure-artifact* Goal

  The [configurator:configure-artifact](./configure-artifact-mojo.html) configures an arbitrary, external artifact.
